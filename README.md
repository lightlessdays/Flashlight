This app quickly and easily turns on the flash next to the rear camera, and keeps it continuously lit. It is a small demo app made as a part of one hour coding sprint. To test this app on your device, you can download the .apk files from the links below:

1. [https://github.com/lightlessdays/flashlight/blob/master/app-arm64-v8a-release.apk?raw=true](ARM64-v8a.apk)
2. [https://github.com/lightlessdays/flashlight/blob/master/app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk?raw=true](ARMABI-v7a.apk)
3. [https://github.com/lightlessdays/flashlight/blob/master/app-x86_64-release.apk?raw=true](x86_64.apk)

Most android smartphones are compatible with the first .apk file. So, if you are unsure about which .apk file to install, it is recommended that you install the first one.
